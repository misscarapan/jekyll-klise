Hi,


 I'm  Cloud Associate and beginner in the cloud native journey and looking for opportunities to start a Cloud path. I was working mainly as make up artist and pretty involve in the personal image industry for the last 7 years. 
 
 Now, I’m challenging myself with cloud because I was creating my own personal website for my make up business and I fall in love with that. I’m AWS Solutions Architect certified and more certifications are coming.

Come with me on this road,
Thanks for reading.
C.
